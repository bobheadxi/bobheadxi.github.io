*[Source](https://github.com/d4rken/reddit-android-appstore) / Android, Java, JUnit*  
The r/Android App Store is an Android application that allows users to conveniently browse a massive community-curated app list. I contributed a range of bug fixes, features and backend restructuring to the project.

## Facebook Messenger Bot with Spotify Integration
`personal`  
*[Source](https://github.com/bobheadxi/facebook-spotify-chatbot) / Node.js, JavaScript, Mocha*  
This bot allows you to interact with Spotify through the Facebook Messenger interface and allows the creation of more tightly controlled public playlists. Users can request for songs to be added to user-hosted playlists, which can then be approved by the host - all conveniently done through Facebook Messenger.
