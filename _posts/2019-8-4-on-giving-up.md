Yesterday, I updated my page about my project [*Timelines*](https://bobheadxi.dev/timelines-recap/)
that tried to recap some things I *did* manage to do in the non-trivial amount
of time I spent on it, despite giving up eventually.

This morning I announced that I'll be stepping down from the co-president role
at UBC Launch Pad after finally getting it following several years as a lead in
the club. Funny because not too long ago I wrote a rather [optimistic post](https://bobheadxi.dev/launch-pad-2018-2019/)
about Launch Pad, and now I'm stepping away from it for the forseeable future.

There's a term I learned during [my time with Riot Games](https://bobheadxi.dev/riot-games/):
*bandwidth*. Up until recently I haven't really considered this an issue - I was
certain I would have the bandwidth for everything I wanted to do, everything I
wanted to learn. It has been taking a bit of a toll, and I think I've found the
reach of my bandwidth this summer. There's a lot I want to explore, and I probably
need to manage my time better.

The matter of giving up is something I've found myself becoming more and
more okay with - on a interpersonal level, on things like side projects
and extracurricular involvements, and in a professional setting. I sometimes
have a fear that doing things and giving up on them is a waste of my time - for
example, I hear about students kicking off startups that become successful, or
building stuff that gets a lot of attention, in a way that makes me wonder if
I should have been putting my efforts into things like that. But giving up
doesn't mean undoing everything you've achieved - it's a bit of a *reprioritization*,
maybe temporary and maybe not, that takes the things you've learned and
accomplished to make your next endeavor more successful. I've grown and learned
so much during [my time with Launch Pad](https://bobheadxi.dev/tags/#launch-pad)
and my [work on *Timelines*](https://bobheadxi.dev/timelines-recap/) for example
(and in hindsight [every project I've worked on](https://bobheadxi.dev/open-source/))
that has helped make me the engineer and person I am today that I don't care
that I've given up on some things in a way might make my work a "waste of time" -
if I had to do it all again, I would.

So here's to the next big things, and more lessons learned.
