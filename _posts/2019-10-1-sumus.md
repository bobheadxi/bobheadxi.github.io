From October 2019 to March 2020, I worked remotely part-time while taking classes at UBC on
Sumus's investment management platform, called the [Sumus Portal](#sumus-portal), and a tool for
generating presentation decks based on data collected by the team, called the [Sumus Pitcher](#sumus-pitcher).

## Sumus Portal

The Sumus Portal is a Node, React+Redux, and MongoDB project. My contributions include:

* automating our entire deployment workflow with automated updates and easy-to-deploy branch previews
  for very little cost with Google App Engine, greatly increasing our development velocity ([blog post](/appengine-branch-previews))
* revamping our transaction handling logic and storage format for reproducibility, improved record keeping,
  and robust versioning capabilities, enabling simpler and more insightful queries on financial data
* developing new interactive elements in the Portal, such as the accounting (see above image),
  account management, and transactions creation interface (amongst other improvements)
* modernised the codebase with improved tooling, sandbox environments, tests, continuous integration, and more

The Sumus Pitcher is a Typescript-based [Figma plugin](https://www.figma.com). The project is
currently a work in progress. My contributions include:

* leading on the design and implementation of the tool by integrating with the Figma plugin API
  and developing a robust, flexible, and extensible framework for working within its constraints
  (including features like simple-to-use interfaces to allow definitions of new templates, an
  easy-to-use format for declaring asset dependencies, and more)
* automating report generation by programmatically interacting with the Figma component tree
* developing integrations with Wordpress to source data for generated reports
* generating maps using the [Mapbox API](https://www.mapbox.com/) and [Google Maps Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro)

See my [blog post](/figma-report-plugin) for a brief writeup of some of my work on this project!
