Ever wanted to find something specific about the University of British Columbia - such as your course site - only to find yourself wading through a hundred irrelevant Google results? Sleuth is a service that will allow anyone to search up UBC-relevant content gathered by our own web crawlers and indexed by our own database built on Solr. These services will be available through a RESTful API and our own website to demo our functionaltiy. It is a work in progress slated for an initial release this December. Follow the project on GitHub to stay up to date on our status!
