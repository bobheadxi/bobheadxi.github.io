description: Reflections on my first two years of remote work
---

As I try to finish up the final stretch of my degree and this tumultuous 2020 draws to a close, I realise that I am almost at this arbitrary two-year milestone in working remotely, both before and during the pandemic. This time of year always brings about a contemplative mood, so I figured I could do a bit of retrospective on this milestone, and use it as an excuse to write another blog post nobody really asked for.

I'll give a bit of an [overview of my experience](#experience), and reflect on a few aspects of remote work that I feel are particularly noteworthy:

* [Collaboration](#collaboration)
* [Lifestyle](#lifestyle) (and a word on [loneliness](#loneliness))
* [Takeaways](#takeaways)

And, of course, some [closing comments](#remote-work-and-me).

<br />

Before we start though, a firm disclaimer: I am by no means an expert at working remotely. I'm no productivity guru, I get lazy with my written standups, I sometimes only skim through meeting notes instead of listening to the whole recording, and I have a hard time sticking to consistent working hours. I do not have any extra monitors, use a standard Apple wireless keyboard, and have never worked on beach (...yet?). This post is just me.

## Experience

First off, a bit of background to show that this post isn't *entirely* ungrounded. I'll denote each experience with a letter for easier reference later.

My remote work timeline kind of goes as follows:

* **Experience A**: September 2018, I got my first stint working remotely part-time for 8 months while taking courses and [working on Launch Pad](https://bobheadxi.dev/what-is-launch-pad/). I was one of maybe two or three developers in [an odd startup](/rtrade-techologies/) trying to make enterprise applications for various blockchain technologies. This was my second technical job.
* **Experience B**: October 2019, I landed another job working remotely part-time for 6 months, again while taking courses but this time without working on Launch Pad. This was a [real estate development startup](/sumus/), where I was the only developer up until my last month there. This was also my fourth technical job.

* **Experience C1**: May 2020, I started as an intern, working remotely full-time for 4 months. Unlike the first two companies, [this was a "real" software company](/sourcegraph/), and I was one of dozens of engineers. In the middle of this internship - around the end of June - I relocated back to Taiwan, putting me at a bit of a time difference with my (then) primarily North American team. This was my fifth technical job.
* **Experience C2**: In September 2020, I switched to a part-time schedule at Sourcegraph and started taking the last courses of my degree. I'm hoping to switch back to full-time at the start of 2021.

In between, I worked two "normal" office jobs, so I do have a bit of a reference point to compare with remote work:

* **Experience X**: a comparatively old-fashioned one [health authority job](/bcgsc/) with cubicles and a coffee machine that required buying a membership to use. I cooked and packed my own lunches, and got to work via a 15-minute bus ride and 5-minute train ride. This was my first technical job ever.
* **Experience Y**: [Californian open-office tech company](/riot-games/) complete with a food court and snack bars. The office was a 5-minute skate ride away from the accomodations we were provided, and I can count on one hand the number of times I got to cook my own meal that summer. This was my third technical job.

I hope this leaves me *somewhat* justified in writing this post :sweat_smile:

## Collaboration

The "remote" in "remote work" is fairly self-explanatory, but the "work" is a bit more obscure, and your mileage will vary significantly from company to company (and likely even team to team), as well with your own personal habits. **I've come to find that the main difference you have to keep in mind is a clear delineation between *synchronous* and *asynchronous* collaboration.**

Synchronous work is the default at an office. If you have a question, generally you'll wait an hour or two at most for your coworker's meeting to end, at which point you can wave awkwardly at them from a few seats over with a desperate look. Important decision-making happens in meetings where you wait your turn to make your voice heard, or you are overpowered by the more talkative senior members in your team, at which point you mention your disagreements to a peer in private and yet another meeting is scheduled. After a meeting, you cross your fingers and hope everyone remembers what happened, or that someone wrote it down.

Asynchronous work is the default at a company that properly supports remote work.

### How my collaboration habits have changed

During Experience A, I mostly just sat down and churned out code, without too much understanding of overarching and long-term goals. I communicated almost entirely asynchronously via text and pull requests, and was exceedingly focused on technical implementation. This was very early on in my career and in hindsight this is not a thing you want to do - I've learned that there's a *lot* more the delivering value and deciding where to invest work than technicalities. My approach to asynchronous work at the time also leaned heavily towards just announcing what I planned to do and charging ahead, which isn't really collaboration.

Experience B is where I first started to think properly about how to do this remote work thing. It involved a more client-contractor relationship, and I would set up pre-meeting notes that laid out topics and questions I wanted to cover in weekly, synchronous meetings so that we could cut to the chase and I could get to class on time. Since this was part-time,

One flaw with both A and B, however, was that I was mostly a one-man show in both. Experience C was my first time working with an actual team remotely, and it came with a series of revelations.

## Lifestyle

I was going to call this section "work-life balance", but after a bit of thought I think "balance" doesn't really reflect my feelings towards (and experience) working remotely. That is, I rarely find myself performing a deliberate balancing act of placing my personal life against work.

### Loneliness?

"I feel very lonely working from home" is a sentiment I hear often, so I imagine this is a bit of a hot topic.

<br />

## Takeaways

No, I don't mean buying takeout every single meal (though I'll be the first to say I love having a big box of food I didn't have to prepare on a cozy evening).
