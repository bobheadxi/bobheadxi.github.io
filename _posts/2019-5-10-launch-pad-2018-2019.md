description: a year at UBC's student-run software engineering club
---

So I wrote this article at the end the semester. Today I finally removed all the
TODOs and hit the publish button:

[UBC Launch Pad Year in Review](https://medium.com/ubc-launch-pad-software-engineering-blog/ubc-launch-pad-year-in-review-2018-2019-6a7444f02c46)

This article is far from my best work - definitely got a little lazy towards the
end :sweat_smile: - but my time with @ubclaunchpad has been a huge part of
helping me get to where I am today, and while it's far from perfect, I really
hope that the club and our events can continue to help students kickstart their
careers and discover the same love for building random things like it did for me.

I'm super thankful for all the work that the leads at UBC Launch Pad put in the
past year to make everything happen, from our projects to our workshops and events,
as well as for our sponsors and partners. I'm also super proud of all the work
everyone put in towards their project. This article doesn't really do it justice,
but I hope it kind of captures a bit of what goes on here at Launch Pad.

To be honest, I could talk all day about Launch Pad. One day, I'll probably write
another post about it, or update this one.
