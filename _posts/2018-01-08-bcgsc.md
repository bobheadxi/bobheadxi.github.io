<i>This page is a work in progress - sorry!</i>

Worked as a software developer for the Bioinformatics Quality Control team in
Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre. Designed and built a well-tested
modularized, maintainable Node.js server from scratch that became the core of
the team's 3 websites. Worked extensively with PostgreSQL databases to set up
queries and data insertion pipelines that needed to handle thousands of row updates
at a time and designed new tables to handle additional data points. Set up an
ElasticSearch instance for monitoring and metric aggregation and developed
application integrations for the platform. Built bioinformatic utilities using
sequence analysis tools like BLAST.
