[UBC Launch Pad](https://www.ubclaunchpad.com/) is a student-run software engineering club whose
primary objective is to be the best space at the [ University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/)
for students to meet other tech enthusiasts, build projects in a team setting, gain experience with
professional development tools and principles, and share their knowledge with others! ðŸš€

I've volunteered in the club for almost a year at this point and worked with a few members in the
club to write an article to try and give people a better idea of what it is we do:

    A photo from the article: ech lead Russell and his team present their plans for
    <a href="https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/rocket2">Rocket2</a>,
    an upcoming rewrite of Launch Padâ€™s management Slack bot. The project is being deployed by <a href="/inertia">Inertia</a>, another Launch Pad project

I've met a lot of awesome people through this club and learned a lot both from senior peers and from
being a lead myself. Check out my [`launch-pad`-tagged blog posts](/tags/#launch-pad)
or [the club website](https://www.ubclaunchpad.com/) to learn more!
