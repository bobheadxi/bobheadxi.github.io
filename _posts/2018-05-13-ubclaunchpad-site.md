I worked briefly on adding some new features to the UBC Launch Pad website,
including:

* a **completely redesigned project showcase** section, featuring automatic
  scrolling, a responsive layout, and more! ([#50](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/ubclaunchpad.github.io-old/pull/50))
* minor improvements such as [emoji support](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/ubclaunchpad.github.io-old/pull/58)
  and other updates
