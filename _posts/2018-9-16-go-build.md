Package `go-build` is an isolated version of the old `build` package I wrote for
[Inertia](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/inertia), a command-line application
that enables easy, self-hosted continuous deployment. It provides a Golang API
for executing `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose`, and
[`Herokuish`](https://github.com/gliderlabs/herokuish) builds and deployments.

The package is still WIP and in the process of being cleaned up, but the bulk of
the code has been in active use in Inertiad for a while - see package
[`inertiad/build`](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/inertia/tree/master/daemon/inertiad/build).

I briefly cover the mechanics of the code used here in my
[Medium post about an early version of Inertia](https://medium.com/ubc-launch-pad-software-engineering-blog/building-continuous-deployment-87a2bd8eedbe).
I also talk about some of the techniques used in
[my post about Docker-in-Docker builds](https://bobheadxi.dev/dockerception/).
