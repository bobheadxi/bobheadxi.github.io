</p>

Since May 2020, I have worked as a software engineering intern at [Sourcegraph](#about-sourcegraph) in the [Distribution team](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/engineering/distribution). The Distribution team is responsible for making Sourcegraph easy to deploy, scale, monitor, and debug, solving challenging problems that our customers face when they deploy and scale Sourcegraph on-premise in a variety of environments, and that we face when we deploy and scale [sourcegraph.com](https://sourcegraph.com/search) (the largest Sourcegraph installation in the world).

During my time at Sourcegraph, my focus has been on expanding the capabilities of Sourcegraph's built-in monitoring stack and improving the experience for administrators of Sourcegraph deployments.

Most of the company's work is open-source, so you can [see my pull requests for Sourcegraph on GitHub](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=org%3Asourcegraph+author%3Abobheadxi+is%3Amerged&s=comments&type=Issues)!
