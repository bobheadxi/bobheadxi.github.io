Well, it's officially (kind of) been one great year since I first began writing lots of code. It's been a bumpy ride.

- **2** failed attempts to get into my school‚Äôs Computer Science major
- **1** internship
- **7** programming languages
- **141** pull requests
- **256** opened issues
- **1659** contributions
- **2.5** hackathons
- **1** conference presentation
- **lots of** bugs
