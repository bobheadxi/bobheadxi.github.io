I joined the [nwPlus](https://www.nwplus.io/) team to work for a while on their
web projects, which powers events like [nwHacks](https://www.nwhacks.io/) - one
of the biggest hackathons in western Canada. During my time with their team, I
helped kickstart work on the nwPlus 2019 website with contributions such as:

* project setup and configuration
* implementations of design assets provided by the nwPlus design team
  ([#20](https://github.com/nwplus/nwhacks2019/pull/20), [#21](https://github.com/nwplus/nwhacks2019/pull/21), 
  [#41](https://github.com/nwplus/nwhacks2019/pull/41), etc.)
* setting up implementation of responsive layouts
  ([#56](https://github.com/nwplus/nwhacks2019/pull/56), etc.)
* internal structuring
  ([#30](https://github.com/nwplus/nwhacks2019/pull/30), [#39](https://github.com/nwplus/nwhacks2019/pull/39), [#14](https://github.com/nwplus/nwhacks2019/pull/14), etc.)
* setting up a development deployment using another student-made tool,
  [Inertia](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/inertia), to enable faster feedback
  and development cycles ([#32](https://github.com/nwplus/nwhacks2019/pull/32))
* helped set up [Google Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/)
  rules and document designs
