At [UBC Launch Pad](https://www.ubclaunchpad.com), many of our teams’ projects are web applications. A pretty awesome step in any web application’s development process is when you deploy it for everyone to try out. Unfortunately, deployment can be a frustrating task, especially for students with little to no experience setting up applications on remote hosts. Some of these students might also be learning a new framework or programming language as part of their projects, all while dealing with the stresses of a full course load. On top of that, we frequently find ourselves needing to deploy projects to new environments as funds run out or sponsorships end in order to keep projects online.

This was an unfortunate situation — seeing your hard work up and running can be a nice motivation boost, and the ability to gather feedback from fellow students is invaluable. We realized that we needed a tool that could make setting up continuously deployed applications simple and painless, regardless of the hosting provider.

So we built one! Inertia is a cross-platform command line tool that aims to simplify setup and management of automated deployment of a variety of project types on any virtual private server. With an effortless 4-step setup process, Inertia has saved UBC Launch Pad teams a great deal of headaches and time deploying, allowing students to focus on building great applications.

This project is currently in active development under my leadership - visit our repository to follow our progress!I have also written a comprensive [Medium blog post](https://medium.com/ubc-launch-pad-software-engineering-blog/building-continuous-deployment-87a2bd8eedbe) detailing what Inertia can do, how it works, and how we built it.

My team and I have also made a few presentations showcasing Inertia to fellow students and industry professionals alike:
