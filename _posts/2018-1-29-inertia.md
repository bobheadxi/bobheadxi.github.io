At [UBC Launch Pad](http://www.ubclaunchpad.com), we are constantly changing cloud providers based on industry sponsors, and as time went on we realized we needed a deployment utility that would allowed us to easily continuously deploy our web apps and move them from server to server.

So we built one! Inertia is a cross-platform command line tool that aims to simplify setup and management of automated deployment of a variety of project types on any virtual private server. With an effortless 4-step setup process, Inertia has saved UBC Launch Pad teams a great deal of headaches and time deploying, allowing students to focus on building great applications.

This project is currently in active development under my leadership - visit our repository to follow our progress!

My team and I have also made a few presentations demonstrating Inertia, its design, and its functionality to fellow students and industry professionals alike:
