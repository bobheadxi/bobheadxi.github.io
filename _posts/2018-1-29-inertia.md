At [UBC Launch Pad](http://www.ubclaunchpad.com), we are constantly changing cloud providers based on industry sponsors, and as time went on we realized we needed a deployment utility that would allowed us to easily continuously deploy our web apps and move them from server to server.

So we built one! Inertia is a cross-platform command line tool that aims to simplify setup and management of automated deployment of docker-compose projects on any virtual private server. It aims to provide the ease and flexibility of services like Heroku without the complexity of Kubernetes while still giving users full control over their projects.

The project is currently in active development under my leadership - visit the repository to follow our progress!
