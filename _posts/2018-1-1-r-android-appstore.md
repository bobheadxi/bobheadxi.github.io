The "r/Android App Store" is an Android application that allows users to conveniently browse a massive [community-curated list of apps](https://www.reddit.com/r/android/wiki/apps) including all sorts of Android applications and games. The app features a comprehensive featureset and boasts a very strong userbase - the two major releases I participated in, v0.7 and v0.8, already has over [30,000 cumulative downloads](http://www.somsubhra.com/github-release-stats/?username=d4rken&repository=reddit-android-appstore). With over 20 merged pull requests, some of my contributions include:
- **new features** such a redesign of one of the app's pages, the ability to automatically tag newly added apps as "new", the ability to save selected filters, a popup to show changelogs pulled from GitHub, markdown to HTML conversion for text, and more

- **refactoring** parts of the app's backend to utilise [Dagger](https://github.com/google/dagger)'s dependency injection capabilities to enable easier testing, as well as making performance improvements by providing application-scoped (singleton) [OkHttpClient](https://github.com/square/okhttp) and [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) instances through Dagger

- rewriting **unit tests** using [JUnit](http://junit.org/junit5/) and [Mockito](http://site.mockito.org) for one of the refactored modules for more comprehensive coverage, and provided unit tests for some of my own contirbutions

- a wide range of **bug fixes** to improve the app's stability

- integrating **test coverage reporting** into the project's CI tool, [Travis](https://travis-ci.org), using [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io)

- **reviewing pull requests** made by new contributors and addressing bug reports and issues raised by the community
