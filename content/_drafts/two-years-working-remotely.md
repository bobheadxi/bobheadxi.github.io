---

Since starting university, I've worked a number of remote software development positions consisting of both part-time and full-time roles - a lot of which happened pre-COVID - as part of my early career. These roles have done much to reshape the way I approach work, collaboration, and how I live my life.

In this post I reflect a bit on almost two years of accumulated experience working remotely and share some of my thoughts on the subject.

## Experience

Before we start, a firm disclaimer: I am by no means an expert at working remotely (or anything, for that matter). This post is just a collection of some of my personal thoughts on what working remotely has been like *for me*. Many of the things I write about here is purely anecdotal - a particular case to consider.

Anyway, I started studying in university in 2016. My remote work timeline roughly goes as follows:

* In September 2018, I landed my first stint working **remotely part-time** as was one of maybe two or three developers in [a local startup](../_experience/2018-8-1-rtrade.md) trying to make enterprise applications for various blockchain technologies. This was my second technical job, and went on for 8 months. I had a full course load in university at the time, as well as some [club commitments](../_posts/2018-12-9-what-is-launch-pad.md).
* In October 2019, I began working **remotely part-time** at [real estate development startup](../_experience/2019-10-1-sumus.md). I was the only developer up until my last month there. This was my fourth technical job, and I was there for 6 months.
* In May 2020, I started as an intern working **remotely full-time**. Unlike the first two companies, [this was a "real" software company](../_experience/2020-5-7-sourcegraph-intern.md), and I was one of dozens of engineers. In the middle of this internship - around the end of June - I relocated back to Taiwan, putting me at a bit of a time difference with my (then) primarily North American team. This was my fifth technical job, and the one that inspired me to write this post - at this company, I realized that remote work is a skill in and of itself.
* In September 2020, I switched to a working **remotely part-time** at the same company and started taking the last courses of my degree.
* In February 2021, I left to start fulfilling my military service requirement for Taiwan, having finished my courses and pretty much graduated.

In between, I worked two "normal" office jobs, so I have a bit of a reference point to compare with remote work:

* In January 2018 (my first technical job ever), I started at a kind of [old-fashioned office co-op at a health authority](../_experience/2018-1-8-bcgsc.md) with cubicles and a coffee machine that required buying a membership to use. I cooked and packed my own lunches and got to work via a 15-minute bus ride and 5-minute train ride.
* In May 2019, I [interned at a well-known Californian game developer](../_experience/2019-5-7-riot-games.md) complete with a food court and snack bars. The open office was a 5-minute skate away from the accommodations we were provided, and I can count on one hand the number of times I cooked my own meal that summer.

## Work

While the "remote" in "remote work" is fairly self-explanatory, your mileage with the "work" part will vary significantly from company to company, and likely even from team to team.

Consistently, however, it seems the most noticeable difference in a remote-first workplace is the prominence of *asynchronous* collaboration, as opposed to *synchronous* collaboration.

With the recent COVID pandemic, it has also become rather popular to conflate "remote work" with "working from home". I think this is a mistake. Firstly, just because you are working remotely doesn't mean you're actually at home all day, as if in lockdown. Secondly, many companies treat "working from home" as "temporarily away from office". They try to bring over the same processes and methods that may have worked in an office but translate poorly into a remote setting.

### Synchronous and asynchronous

My interpretation:

- If you have a question, generally you'll run over to your co-worker's desk and just ask. Important decision-making happens in live meetings, whether in person or over video calls. Everything happens in real-time: you ask a question, you at least expect to get a response on the spot, and if you don't it blocks your progress. This is *synchronous* work.
- You have a generally minimal expectation of an immediate response on most things. Important decision-making happens across a mix of minimal meetings and written discussions and documents. This kind of work includes things like churning out code by yourself, reviewing a pull request on your own, or writing a report. Collaboration is structured to support members in making decisions so that interdependencies don't block progress. This is *asynchronous* work.

The most immediate difference is the emphasis on *autonomy* - asynchronous work focuses on giving you the tools and resources to make sound decisions on your own, and doesn't hold you as closely to the requirements of others.

I often hear concerns, especially from students or recent graduates, that the lack of synchronous communication opportunities attached to a remote job might be a blocker for learning opportunities or support channels. While there are definitely cons to consider (which I'll get to in a bit), there are a few things I've found in office settings that negate the positives of having ample synchronous time together:

- Just because your co-worker's desk is a few seats over, doesn't mean that your questions will be answered immediately anyway. They might have meetings themselves, or some scheduled focus time. You will probably have meetings of your own to attend. I've even occasionally found the expectation that both parties have spare time at the same time to be a blocker to getting an answer that could have been communicated quickly over a message. **An immediate response is not always a reasonable expectation**, *especially* in a professional environment.
- Meetings, depending on team culture, can be a poor medium for communication. **You wait your turn to make your voice heard, or you are overpowered by the more talkative senior members in your team**. Debating a point live is also a skill that requires practice, and if you come up with a point after the fact there might not be a channel for you to communicate it short of another meeting. If you are a junior team member, this will probably not help your confidence.
- **When knowledge can be easily transferred verbally, there is not much incentive to write it down, leading to an ever-growing amount of "tribal knowledge": information that you can only get by knowing the right person, or asking the right question**. Knowledge gets forgotten, lost, or miscommunicated. As an inexperienced employee, this makes life very difficult for you too, and will seriously hamper your ability to figure out what is going on.

### Precision and freedom

Precision is vital to collaborative processes. If participants are misaligned, that can lead to all sorts of mess. It *feels* more precise to have an announcement made in person, where you can look at very participant and verify that yes, they are indeed here, and they are not asleep - and better yet, nodding in approval. It *feels* more precise to have somebody sit down next to you and give you the exact answer you are looking for.

On the other hand, freedom is where innovation is born - and it seems the office empowers freedom, through the hallway chats, the lunch break discussions, and more. But with this type of freedom you lose precision: people miss out on discussions, TODO

So how could we strike a better balance between the need for both precision *and* freedom in any collaborative undertaking?

> [...] the open-source world was shaped by the needs of remote workers. Each new iteration of version control software made it easier for remote workers to write great software by overcoming obstacles that impeded collaboration. Broadly speaking, success was achieved by balancing two seemingly opposed design imperatives: ensuring equitable access to precise information about the state of a project and decentralizing control over the process of creation as much as possible.

### A different world

Consider that many workplace practices - fixed hours, meetings, and having an office - was designed for a *very* different world, one without the advances of mobile computing, internet availability, instant messaging, and robust suites of documentation, task management, and collaboration tools.

Some practices also come from a world where the *type* of work many people do is different. Sure, back when I worked a retail job it wasn't really feasible for me to just come and go whenever I wanted. But the work that a lot of white-collar jobs entail nowadays fall into creative or knowledge work - roles that primarily depend on the *decisions* being made.

If we were to completely redesign the way we think about working, what would that look like? If we focused on the essence of work is trying to accomplish, would we still adopt the practices we have today?

If we were to reconsider *where* and *when* we do our work, is the best approach really to be in the same physical space at the same time doing our thing?

> Then, as we continued to talk to different companies and read about the history of the office, and the history of office culture, and how things have really shifted over the last 100 years, there was this really fascinating portrait of all the ways in which culture, particularly, was broken, and exclusionary, and built to privilege the same types of people, which is oftentimes white men who are able to live in urban areas, and how we can try to use remote work and actual flexibility to reimagine the placement of work in our lives.

<p align="right"><i><a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/work-culture/anne-helen-petersen-workplace-flexibility">Why work flexibility should be the standard, not a luxury</a></i></p>

Consider another such common goal: "a decision must be made". Does that really mean "we must get together and talk at the same time"?

> Here‚Äôs another angle: when you meet and discuss things in person ‚Äî as opposed to in written, virtual form ‚Äî it‚Äôs easy for the loudest person in the room to own the discussion [...] But when the main communication channels are asynchronous text and video calls (as would be the case in a remote work setup) the influence of the loudest person in the room wanes. It‚Äôs transferred to the best communicators.

### Asynchronous by default

Consider a world where we *don't* expect an immediate response when collaborating, where we give up on the idea of using top-down control to achieve precision.

You won't need to come up with replies on the spot, or interrupt your workflow to answer a question. It might become easier to accept feedback, because you can take a moment to digest it and understand its benefits. You can carefully write out your arguments and considerations in response to a proposal. Decision-making is a well-documented process, taking on RFC-like formats that outline the steps leading up to a decision, rather than happening in transient conversations. Knowledge is transferred while taking into consideration that *most* people this information could be useful to aren't actually there at the moment, and should likely be documented in a more durable format. And so on, and so forth.

In this world, we work provide each other with the information and tools required to have more autonomy in our work. We have more context at our fingertips with the myriad of tools available to us: we are in a better position to make good decisions, better equipped with the resources to act upon them, and more equally empowered to participate in group processes.

## Lifestyle

I was going to call this section "work-life balance", but after a bit of thought I think "balance" doesn't really reflect my feelings towards (and experience) working remotely. That is, after some time I rarely find myself performing a deliberate balancing act of placing my personal life against work. More and more, I think, "this is the life I want to have, and these are the things I want to do - how can I mould my work around it?"

### Performance, or performances?

COVID lockdowns have also shaped a lot of opinions on this subject. I think a lot of people ended up letting work more or less dominate their lives, with stories of never-ending hours and constant stress.

I definitely fell victim to this in the early months at my first remote job. Work easily dragged on into the night, overlapping with all my meals, and burnout meant that it was all too easy to go from Slack to *slack* while forgetting everything in between. This was especially evident on top of the full course load and school club responsibilities I was taking on at the same time. Laundry went undone, dishes unwashed, homework incomplete, and it began to put considerable strain on other aspects of my life.

TODO

### Loneliness

That remote work can be lonely is a sentiment I hear often. However, COVID lockdowns aside, I've found myself far more able to be with the people I care about when working remotely.

I have the time and freedom to meet up with them at their offices for lunch or at the end of a day. I get to go pursue my hobbies at whatever off-peak hour fits my mood and more comfortably connect with random folks in far less crowded environments. I feel more comfortable participating in events and gatherings, and find myself saying "no, I'm too tired" far less often.

A remote-first company should take steps to ensure that employees find ways to stay connected. For example, they might host meetups and events or fund tickets to relevant conferences. One company had a nifty Slack bot that would pair you up with random people at the company and give you a time to chat and get to know each other in a non-work-related context. I loved these chats, and it helped to dedicate time for getting to know each other without it feeling weird to schedule one.

This is a bit of a recurring theme: **while remote takes away some of the structures and support frameworks and decisions made for you, it gives you the agency and autonomy to make your own**.

## Takeaways

No, I don't mean buying takeout every night (though I'll be the first to say I love having a big box of food I didn't have to prepare on a cozy evening). The takeaways I want to point out are some mindsets and thought processes that working remotely encourages you to adopt that, I think, have proven valuable to me IRL ("in real life").

I say "in real life" as if work isn't a part of it because I really don't think work should define your life. While I am extremely fortunate to I work in a field that I enjoy, I'm not sure I want the majority of most days of my life to revolve around my career.

Agency is our most valuable possession.
