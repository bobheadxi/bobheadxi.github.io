Ever since starting university, I've worked a number of remote software development positions, consisting of both part-time and full-time roles, a lot of which happened pre-COVID. In this post I reflect a bit on almost two years of accumulated experience working remotely, covering what the work has been like, the lifestyle, and some takeaways.

## Experience

Before we start, a firm disclaimer: I am by no means an expert at working remotely (or anything, for that matter). This post is just a collection of some of my personal thoughts on what working remotely has been like for me.

My remote work timeline roughly goes as follows:

* In September 2018, I got my first stint working **remotely part-time** as was one of maybe two or three developers in [a local startup](/rtrade-techologies/) trying to make enterprise applications for various blockchain technologies. This was my second technical job, and went on for 8 months. I had a full course load at the same time and some [club commitments](/what-is-launch-pad).
* In October 2019, I began working **remotely part-time** at [real estate development startup](/sumus/). I was the only developer up until my last month there. This was my fourth technical job, and I was there for 6 months.
* In May 2020, I started as an intern working **remotely full-time**. Unlike the first two companies, [this was a "real" software company](/sourcegraph/), and I was one of dozens of engineers. In the middle of this internship - around the end of June - I relocated back to Taiwan, putting me at a bit of a time difference with my (then) primarily North American team. This was my fifth technical job, and the one that inspired me to write this post - at this company, I realized that remote work is a skill in and of itself.
* In September 2020, I switched to a working **remotely part-time** schedule at the same company and started taking the last courses of my degree.
* In February 2021, I left to start fulfilling my military service requirement for Taiwan.

In between, I worked two "normal" office jobs, so I have a bit of a reference point to compare with remote work:

* In January 2018 (my first technical job ever), I started at a kind of [old-fashioned office co-op at a health authority](/bcgsc/) with cubicles and a coffee machine that required buying a membership to use. I cooked and packed my own lunches and got to work via a 15-minute bus ride and 5-minute train ride.
* In May 2019, I [interned at a well-known Californian game developer](/riot-games/) complete with a food court and snack bars. The open office was a 5-minute skate away from the accommodations we were provided, and I can count on one hand the number of times I cooked my own meal that summer.

## Work

While the "remote" in "remote work" is fairly self-explanatory, your mileage with the "work" part will vary significantly from company to company, and likely even from team to team.

With the recent COVID pandemic, it has also become rather popular to conflate "remote work" with "working from home". I think this is a mistake though - firstly, just because you're remote doesn't mean you're actually at home all day as if in lockdown. Secondly, many companies treat "working from home" as "temporarily away from office" and not "remote". They cling to the same processes and methods that may have worked in an office but translate poorly into a remote setting, with no real intention of adapting.

I've found the most noticeable difference in a remote-first workplace is the prominence of *asynchronous* collaboration, as opposed to *synchronous* collaboration.

### Synchronous and asynchronous

My interpretation:

- *Synchronous* work is the default at an office. If you have a question, generally you'll run over to your co-worker's desk and just ask. Important decision-making happens in live meetings, whether in person or over video calls. Everything happens in real-time: you ask a question, you get a response on the spot, and if a response
- *Asynchronous* work is the default at a company that properly supports remote work. There's a generally minimal expectation of an immediate response, so your questions have a non-zero chance of not being immediately answered. Important decision-making happens across a mix of documented or recorded meetings and written discussions. This kind of work includes things like churning out code by yourself, reviewing a pull request on your own, or writing a report.

I often hear concerns, especially from students or recent graduates, that the lack of synchronous communication opportunities attached to a remote job might be a blocker for learning opportunities or support channels. While there are definitely cons to consider (which I'll get to in a bit), there are a few things I've found in office settings that negate the positives of having ample synchronous time together:

- Just because your co-worker's desk is a few seats over, doesn't mean that your questions will be answered immediately anyway. They might have meetings themselves, or some scheduled focus time. You will probably have meetings of your own to attend. I've even occasionally found the expectation that both parties have spare time at the same time to be a blocker to getting an answer that could have been communicated quickly over a message. **An immediate response is not always a reasonable expectation**, *especially* in a professional environment.
- Meetings, depending on team culture, can be a poor medium for communication. **You wait your turn to make your voice heard, or you are overpowered by the more talkative senior members in your team**. Debating a point live is also a skill that requires practice, and if you come up with a point after the fact there might not be a channel for you to communicate it short of another meeting. If you are a junior team member, this will probably not help your confidence.
- **When knowledge can be easily transferred verbally, there is not much incentive to write it down, leading to an ever-growing amount of "tribal knowledge": information that you can only get by knowing the right person, or asking the right question**. Knowledge gets forgotten, lost, or miscommunicated. As an inexperienced employee, this makes life very difficult for you too, and will seriously hamper your ability to figure out what is going on.

### A different world

Consider that many workplace practices - fixed hours, meetings, and having an office - was designed for a *very* different world, one without the advances of mobile computing, internet availability, instant messaging, and robust suites of documentation, task management, and collaboration tools.

A good question to ask might be - if we were to completely redesign the way we *think* about working together, what would that look like? Would it *really* mean that every decision needs a live meeting when massive open-source projects collaborate globally via email? Would it mean long commutes to office every day when many of us don't spend anywhere near as much time commuting to see our friends and family?

### Asynchronous by default

Consider a world where we *don't* expect an immediate response when collaborating. You won't need to come up with replies on the spot, or interrupt your workflow to answer a question. It might become easier to accept feedback, because you can take a moment to digest it and understand its benefits. You can carefully write out your arguments and considerations in response to a proposal. Decision-making is a well-documented process, taking on RFC-like formats that outline the steps leading up to a decision, rather than happening in transient conversations. Knowledge is transferred while taking into consideration that *most* people this information could be useful to aren't actually there at the moment, and should likely be documented in a more durable format. And so on, and so forth.

In this world, perhaps we can work to provide each other with the information and tools required to have more autonomy in our work. We have more context at our fingertips with the myriad of tools available to us, are in a better position to make good decisions, and are equipped with the resources to act upon them.

## Lifestyle

I was going to call this section "work-life balance", but after a bit of thought I think "balance" doesn't really reflect my feelings towards (and experience) working remotely. That is, after some time I rarely find myself performing a deliberate balancing act of placing my personal life against work. More and more, I think, "this is the life I want to have, and these are the things I want to do - how can I mould my work around it?"

### An evolving workday

COVID lockdowns have also shaped a lot of opinions on this subject. I think a lot of people ended up letting work more or less dominate their lives, with stories of never-ending hours and constant stress.

I definitely fell victim to this in the early months at my first remote job. TODO

### Loneliness

That remote work can be lonely is a sentiment I hear often. However, COVID lockdowns aside, I've found myself far more able to be with the people I care about when working remotely.

I have the time and freedom to meet up with them at their offices for lunch or at the end of a day. I get to go pursue my hobbies at whatever off-peak hour fits my mood and more comfortably connect with random folks in far less crowded environments. I feel more comfortable participating in events and gatherings, and find myself saying "no, I'm too tired" far less often.

A remote-first company should take steps to ensure that employees find ways to stay connected. For example, they might host meetups and events or fund tickets to relevant conferences. One company had a nifty Slack bot that would pair you up with random people at the company and give you a time to chat and get to know each other in a non-work-related context. I loved these chats, and it helped to dedicate time for getting to know each other without it feeling weird to schedule one.

This is a bit of a recurring theme: that remote takes away some of the enforced choices, but gives you the agency to make your own. This is especially true in our interpersonal relationships.

## Takeaways

No, I don't mean buying takeout every single meal (though I'll be the first to say I love having a big box of food I didn't have to prepare on a cozy evening). The takeaways I want to point out are some mindsets and thought processes that working remotely encourages you to adopt that, I think, have proven valuable to me IRL ("in real life").

I say "in real life" as if work isn't a part of it because I really don't think work should define your life. While I am extremely fortunate to I work in a field that I enjoy, I'm not sure I want the majority of most days of my life to revolve around my career.
