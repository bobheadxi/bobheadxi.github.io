So today day I gave a big "Developer's Guide to Docker" workshop at my university!
The goal was to introduce the concept of containerized services, how they
are leveraged in industry, and how small-scale projects can take advantage of
Docker during development.

A lot of fun, though I always look a bit strange when presenting. :sweat_smile:
