[UBC Launch Pad](https://ubclaunchpad.com/) is a student-run software engineering club whose
primary objective is to be the best space at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/)
for students to meet other tech enthusiasts, build projects in a team setting, gain experience with
professional development tools and principles, and share their knowledge with others! ðŸš€

I've met a lot of awesome people through this club and learned a lot both from senior peers and from
being a lead myself. Check out my [`launch-pad`-tagged blog posts](/tags/#launch-pad)
