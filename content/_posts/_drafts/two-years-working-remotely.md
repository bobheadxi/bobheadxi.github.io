As I try to finish up the final stretch of my degree and this tumultuous 2020 draws to a close, I realise that I am almost at this arbitrary two-year milestone in working remotely, both before and during the pandemic. This time of year always brings about a contemplative mood, so I figured I could do a bit of retrospective on this milestone, and use it as an excuse to write another blog post nobody really asked for.

I'll give a bit of an [overview of my experience](#experience), and reflect on a few aspects of remote work that I feel are noteworthy:

* ü§ù  [Work](#work)

* üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  [Lifestyle](#lifestyle) (and a word on [loneliness](#loneliness))

* ü•°  [Takeaways](#takeaways)

And, of course, some [closing comments](#remote-work-and-me).

<br />

Before we start though, a firm disclaimer: I am by no means an expert at working remotely. I'm no productivity guru, I get lazy with my written standups, I sometimes only skim through meeting notes instead of listening to the whole recording, and I have a hard time sticking to consistent working hours. I do not have any extra monitors, use a standard Apple wireless keyboard, and have never worked on beach (...yet?). This post is just me.

## Experience

First off, a bit of background to show that this post isn't *entirely* ungrounded. I'll denote each experience with a letter for easier reference later.

My remote work timeline kind of goes as follows:

* In September 2018, I got my first stint working remotely part-time for 8 months while taking courses and [working on Launch Pad](https://bobheadxi.dev/what-is-launch-pad/). I was one of maybe two or three developers in [a local startup](/rtrade-techologies/) trying to make enterprise applications for various blockchain technologies. This was my second technical job.

* In October 2019, I landed another job working remotely part-time for 6 months, again while taking courses but this time without working on Launch Pad. This was a [real estate development startup](/sumus/), where I was the only developer up until my last month there. This was also my fourth technical job.

* In May 2020, I started as an intern working remotely full-time for 4 months. During this time I also went back to help lead Launch Pad for a while. Unlike the first two companies, [this was a "real" software company](/sourcegraph/), and I was one of dozens of engineers. In the middle of this internship - around the end of June - I relocated back to Taiwan, putting me at a bit of a time difference with my (then) primarily North American team. This was my fifth technical job.

* In September 2020, I switched to a part-time schedule at the above company and started taking the last courses of my degree.

* As of January 2021, I am back to being full-time at the same company as I wait for final dates for my military service conscription.

In between, I worked two "normal" office jobs, so I do have a bit of a reference point to compare with remote work:

* In January 2018 (my first technical job ever), I started at a *comparatively* [old-fashioned office co-op at a health authority](/bcgsc/) with cubicles and a coffee machine that required buying a membership to use. I cooked and packed my own lunches and got to work via a 15-minute bus ride and 5-minute train ride.

* In May 2019, I got the opportunity to [intern at a famous Californian game developer](/riot-games/) complete with a food court and snack bars. The open office was a 5-minute skate away from the accomodations we were provided, and I can count on one hand the number of times I cooked my own meal that summer.

## Work

The "remote" in "remote work" is fairly self-explanatory, but the "work" part is a bit more obscure, and your mileage will vary significantly from company to company (and likely even team to team), as well with your own personal habits.

That said, I've found the most noticable difference in a remote workplace is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous work becomes very apparent.

### Synchronous and asynchronous

My interpretation:

- *Synchronous* work is the default at an office. If you have a question, generally you'll run over to your co-worker's desk and just ask. Important decision-making happens in live meetings, whether in person or over video calls.

- *Asynchronous* work is the default at a company that properly supports remote work. There's a generally minimal expectation of an immediate response, so your questions have a non-zero chance of not being immediately answered. Important decision-making happens across a mix of documented or recorded meetings and written discussions. This kind of work includes things like churning out code by yourself, reviewing a pull request on your own, or writing a report.

I often hear concerns, especially from students or recent graduates, that the lack of synchronous communication opportunities attached to a remote job might be a blocker for learning opportunities or support channels. While there are definitely cons to consider (which I'll get to in a bit), there are a few things I've found in office settings that negate the positives of having ample synchronous time together:

- Just because your co-worker's desk is a few seats over, doesn't mean that your questions will be answered immediately anyway. They might have meetings themselves, or some scheduled focus time. You will probably have meetings of your own to attend. I've even occasionally found the expectation that both parties have spare time at the same time to be a blocker to getting an answer that could have been communicated quickly over a message.
- Meetings, depending on team culture, can be a bit of a poor medium for communication. You wait your turn to make your voice heard, or you are overpowered by the more talkative senior members in your team. After a meeting, you cross your fingers and hope everyone remembers what happened, or that someone wrote it down. Debating a point live can be a bit of a skill that requires practice, so if you come up with a point after the fact there might not be a channel for you to communicate it short of another meeting.

- Since knowledge can be easily transferred verbally, there is not much incentive to write it down, leading to an ever-growing amount of "tribal knowledge": information that you can only get by knowing the right person, or asking the right question. Knowledge gets forgotten, lost, or miscommunicated. This is especially consequential in teams with lots of ownership areas or organizations with high member turnover (such as Launch Pad) - missing knowledge transfer will often result in repeated work, or failure to adapt and grow from past experiences.

When working remotely, needless to say the opportunties for these downsides to come up are more limited due to being more reliant on asynchronous collaboration. A few positives also come out of a heavier dependence on being asynchronous:

- Sdf

- How you see people is very different: when your primary interaction is 
- Thorsten Ball (author of *Writing an Interpreter in Go* and *Writing a Compiler in Go*) has a post, [What you think is bad about remote work, can, well, actually be good](https://thorstenball.com/blog/2020/05/22/what-you-think-is-bad-about-remote-work-can-actually-be-good/), that goes over this point nicely.

## Lifestyle

I was going to call this section "work-life balance", but after a bit of thought I think "balance" doesn't really reflect my feelings towards (and experience) working remotely. That is, I rarely find myself performing a deliberate balancing act of placing my personal life against work - more and more,

### An evolving workday

### Loneliness

"I feel very lonely working from home" is a sentiment I hear often, so I imagine this is a bit of a hot topic.

## Takeaways

No, I don't mean buying takeout every single meal (though I'll be the first to say I love having a big box of food I didn't have to prepare on a cozy evening). The takeaways I want to point out are some mindsets and thought processes that working remotely encourages you to adopt that, I think, have proven valuable to me IRL ("in real life").

I say "in real life" as if work isn't a part of it because I really don't think work should define your life. While I am extremely fortunate to I work in a field that I enjoy, I'm not sure I want the majority of most days of my life to revolve around my career.
