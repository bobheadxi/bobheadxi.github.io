I joined the [nwPlus](https://www.nwplus.io/) team to work for a while on their
web projects, which powers events like [nwHacks](https://www.nwhacks.io/) - one
of the biggest hackathons in western Canada. During my time with their team, I
helped kickstart work on the nwHacks 2019 website with contributions such as:

* project setup and configuration
* **implementations of design assets** provided by the nwPlus design team
  ([#20](https://github.com/nwplus/nwhacks2019/pull/20), [#21](https://github.com/nwplus/nwhacks2019/pull/21),
  [#41](https://github.com/nwplus/nwhacks2019/pull/41), etc.)
* setting up **implementation of responsive layouts**
  ([#56](https://github.com/nwplus/nwhacks2019/pull/56), etc.)
* internal structuring
  ([#30](https://github.com/nwplus/nwhacks2019/pull/30), [#39](https://github.com/nwplus/nwhacks2019/pull/39), [#14](https://github.com/nwplus/nwhacks2019/pull/14), etc.)
* setting up a development deployment using another student-made tool,
  [Inertia](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/inertia), that
  **enabled faster feedback and development cycles** ([#32](https://github.com/nwplus/nwhacks2019/pull/32))
* helped set up [Google Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/)
  rules and document designs

  <figcaption>Navigation bar implementation demo from

  Demos were very helpful for both the dev team and the designers to quickly
  give feedback to each other and improve designs that maybe don't look so great
  in practice - for example, <a href="https://github.com/nwplus/nwhacks2019/pull/41#pullrequestreview-145049016" target="_blank">the navigation bar design was changed</a>
  once a designer had a look at the implementation.</figcaption>
