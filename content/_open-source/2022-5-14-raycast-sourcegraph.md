Raycast for Sourcegraph is an extension for [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/), a MacOS launcher, to integrate directly with [Sourcegraph](https://about.sourcegraph.com), a code intelligence platform, through Sourcegraph's [GraphQL](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/api/graphql) and [server-sent events (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) [stream API](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/api/stream_api). The extension is built in Typescript and React using [Raycast's extensions API](https://developers.raycast.com/).

With the extension, you can get fast results as you type on [code search](https://about.sourcegraph.com/code-search) over your code and 2M+ public repositories. Other features include:

- Browse, search, and preview [search notebooks](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/notebooks) that enable powerful live – and persistent – documentation, shareable with your organization or the world.
- Manage changesets in [batch changes](https://about.sourcegraph.com/batch-changes) to automate large-scale code changes to keep your code up to date, fix critical security issues, and pay down tech debt across all of your repositories.
