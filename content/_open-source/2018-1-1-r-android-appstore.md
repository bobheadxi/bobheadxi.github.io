The "r/Android App Store" is an Android application that allows users to
conveniently browse a massive [community-curated list of apps](https://www.reddit.com/r/android/wiki/apps)
including all sorts of Android applications and games. The app features a
comprehensive featureset and boasts a very strong userbase - the app has almost
[100,000 cumulative downloads](https://www.somsubhra.com/github-release-stats/?username=d4rken&repository=reddit-android-appstore).
With over 20 merged pull requests, some of my contributions include:

* **new features** such as a complete redesign of one of the app's pages, the
  ability to automatically tag newly added apps as "new", the ability to save
  selected filters, a popup to show changelogs pulled from GitHub, markdown to
  HTML conversion for text, and more
* **refactoring** parts of the app's backend to utilise
  [Dagger](https://github.com/google/dagger)'s dependency injection capabilities
  to enable easier testing, as well as making performance improvements by providing
  application-scoped (singleton) [OkHttpClient](https://github.com/square/okhttp)
  and [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) instances through Dagger
  ([related blog post](/dependency-injection/))
* rewriting **unit tests** using [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) and
  [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org) for one of the refactored modules for
  more comprehensive coverage, and provided unit tests for some of my own
  contributions
* a wide range of **bug fixes** to improve the app's stability
* integrating **test coverage reporting** into the project's CI tool,
  [Travis](https://travis-ci.org), using [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io)
* **reviewing pull requests** made by new contributors and addressing bug reports
  and issues raised by the community
