Since July 2021, I have been working as a software engineer at [Sourcegraph](#about-sourcegraph).
I started in [the Distribution team that I was in as a Software Engineer Intern](2020-5-7-sourcegraph-intern.md) working on problems surrounding how Sourcegraph is deployed and operated in both [Sourcegraph Cloud](https://sourcegraph.com/search) and on-premise deployments, but later moved to the newly created Developer Experience team.
The Developer Experience team's mission is to make it so that every developer feels empowered to be productive in contributing to the Sourcegraph application.

In addition to work directly related to the Distribution and Developer Experience teams' ownership areas, I have also contributed to parts of the core application, such as working on [scaling GitHub permissions mirroring](../_posts/2021-10-8-mirroring-github-permissions-at-scale.md).
