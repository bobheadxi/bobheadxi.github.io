Starting in July 2021, I have been working as a software engineer at [Sourcegraph](#about-sourcegraph) on the [Distribution team](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/engineering/distribution).
The Distribution team is responsible for making Sourcegraph easy to deploy, scale, monitor, and debug.
The team also solves challenging problems that our customers face when they deploy and scale Sourcegraph on-premise in a variety of environments, and that Sourcegraph faces when we deploy and scale [Sourcegraph Cloud](https://sourcegraph.com/search) (the largest Sourcegraph installation in the world).

Previously, I [also worked at Sourcegraph as Software Engineer Intern](2020-5-7-sourcegraph-intern.md).
