Since July 2021, I have been working as a software engineer at [Sourcegraph](#about-sourcegraph), mostly in the the newly created [Developer Experience team](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/product-engineering/engineering/enablement/dev-experience).
The Developer Experience team's mission is to make it so that every developer feels empowered to be productive in contributing to the Sourcegraph application.

As part of the Developer Experience team, I've contributed extensively to:

- [`sg`, the Sourcegraph developer tool](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/background-information/sg)
- Sourcegraph's continuous integration infrastructure and [pipeline generator](https://sourcegraph.com/notebooks/Tm90ZWJvb2s6MTE3)
- the [Sourcegraph monitoring generator](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/background-information/observability/monitoring-generator)
- [Sourcegraph's managed instances tooling and processes](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/product-engineering/engineering/enablement/delivery/managed)
- the [Sourcegraph developer experience newsletter](https://handbook.sourcegraph.com/departments/product-engineering/engineering/enablement/dev-experience/newsletter)

...and more.

In addition to work directly related to the Distribution and Developer Experience teams' ownership areas, I have also contributed to parts of the core application, such as:

- [scaling GitHub permissions mirroring](../_posts/2021-10-8-mirroring-github-permissions-at-scale.md) for large enterprises and supporting the continued maintainence of Sourcegraph's permissions syncing systems
- designing and developing [an extended permissions model for Sourcegraph](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues/27916), notably [implementing expanded access control parsing for Perforce](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/pull/26745)
- creating [standardized actor propagation tooling](https://sourcegraph.com/notebooks/Tm90ZWJvb2s6OTI=) across services

Most of the company's work is open-source, so you can [see my pull requests for Sourcegraph on GitHub](https://github.com/search?l=&o=desc&q=org%3Asourcegraph+author%3Abobheadxi+is%3Amerged+created%3A%3E2021-05-01&s=comments&type=Issues)!
