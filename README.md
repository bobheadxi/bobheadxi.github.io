# bobheadxi.dev [![website status](https://img.shields.io/website/https/bobheadxi.dev.svg?down_color=lightgrey&down_message=offline&label=website&up_message=online)](https://bobheadxi.dev)

This is the Jekyll source for my website, [`bobheadxi.dev`](https://bobheadxi.dev).
It is a heavily modified version of the [indigo theme](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo).

## Structure

##### `_posts`

It says "posts" but it's been repurposed to be the source of all my [blog posts](https://bobheadxi.dev/blog),
[experience pages](https://bobheadxi.dev), and [project pages](https://bobheadxi.dev/open-source).

##### `assets`

Source for most of the images and stuff used throughout the site.

##### `open-source`

Source for [`bobheadxi.dev/open-source`](https://bobheadxi.dev/open-source).

##### `r`

Source for my redirect links (ie `https://bobheadxi.dev/r/...`).

## Development
