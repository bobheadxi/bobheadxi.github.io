Hi! I am a mathematics student studying at the University of British Columbia
with a passion for technology and [building cool things](https://bobheadxi.dev/open-source/).

I also have a soft spot for [mountains, trees, making gifs that loop](https://pics.bobheadxi.dev/),
and [occasionally writing](https://bobheadxi.dev/blog/).
