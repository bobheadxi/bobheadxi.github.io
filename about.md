# About Me

Hey! I am a mathematics student studying at the University of British Columbia
with a passion for technology and [building cool things](https://bobheadxi.dev/open-source/).

My professional experience includes internships at [Riot Games](/riot-games) and
the [Michael Smith Genome Sciences Center](/bcgsc) as well as part-time software
development jobs at startups like [Sumus Property Group](/sumus)
(where I work right now) and [RTrade Technologies](/rtrade-technologies).

Outside of work and class, I also participated actively as
a [tech lead in UBC Launch Pad](https://bobheadxi.dev/tags/#launch-pad)
(a student-run software engineering club at my university) and as a
[web developer with nwPlus](https://bobheadxi.dev/nwhacks2019/) (the group
that organizes one of the largest hackathons in western Canada).

A condensed (though sometimes outdated) summary of my experience is also available
in [resume form](https://resume.bobheadxi.dev) if you prefer that!

When not fiddling with tech, I have a soft spot for
[mountains, trees, making gifs that loop](https://pics.bobheadxi.dev/),
and [occasionally writing](https://bobheadxi.dev/blog/). All opinions are mine.
