<h1 style="font-weight:500;margin-top:-0.5rem;text-align:center;">about me!</h1>

Hey! My name is Robert and I am a mathematics student studying at the University of British Columbia
with a [passion for tech and building stuff](https://bobheadxi.dev/open-source/).
My professional experience includes software engineering internships at [Riot Games](/riot-games)
and the [Michael Smith Genome Sciences Center](/bcgsc) as well as part-time, remote
software development positions at startups like [Sumus Property Group](/sumus) and [RTrade Technologies](/rtrade-techologies/).

Outside of work and class, I participated actively for almost 2 years as
a [tech lead in UBC Launch Pad](https://bobheadxi.dev/what-is-launch-pad), leading and mentoring teams
of students on collaborative projects and driving programs and workshops aimed at building a
community of aspiring software engineers at my university. I also volunteered as a
[web developer for nwPlus](https://bobheadxi.dev/nwhacks2019/) building the website and application
system behind one of the largest hackathons in western Canada, nwHacks.

My tech interests currently lie primarily in empowering people to build things better, faster, and more
effectively. Software has become an integral part of every facet of life, and I believe that ever-improving
tools, automation, and a culture of transparency (I have the open-source world to thank for pretty
much everything I know) will become a key driver of innovations to come.
I've tried exploring these areas myself with projects like [a self-hosted build and deployment platform](/inertia),
[automated benchmark visualization](/gobenchdata-project/),
[tooling to set up branch deployments on a budget](https://bobheadxi.dev/appengine-branch-previews/),
[a foray into building a service to analyse project growth](https://bobheadxi.dev/timelines-recap/),
[some libraries](https://bobheadxi.dev/tags/#library), and more - and I hope to continue learning
more and one day making more significant contributions!

When not fiddling with tech, I have a soft spot for
[mountains, trees, making gifs that loop](https://pics.bobheadxi.dev/), reading,
and [occasionally writing](https://bobheadxi.dev/blog/) about my work and things that interest me
(all opinions are mine). I used to run pretty frequently and ran a full marathon a few years back.
More recently, I've been enjoying working on improving my bouldering, skateboarding, and snowboarding.

# why "bobheadxi"?

The online handle `bobheadxi` is one I've had for too long to abandon, so I use it for most things
nowadays. The `xi` part stands for `11`, and nothing else :)
