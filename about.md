Robert (Pin-Chun) Lin is a mathematics student studying at the University of British Columbia. When asked to write a bio about himself he writes in third person, but he promises that he does not do this on a regular basis.

With experience in languages like Go, Javascript, Python, Java, and more, Robert has worked on [a wide range of projects and platforms](https://bobheadxi.github.io/projects/). His work includes maintaining a popular [open-source Android application](https://bobheadxi.github.io/r-android-appstore/), leading a team to build a [continuous deployment app](https://bobheadxi.github.io/inertia/), and working with a partner to create a [domain-specific search engine](https://bobheadxi.github.io/sleuth/).

When he's not working on [UBC Launch Pad](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad) (a software engineering club at UBC) projects, Robert can be found relaxing in Brekka Cafe writing about everything from [simple object casting with polymorphic classes in Javascript](https://bobheadxi.github.io/object-casting-in-javascript/) to [epigenetics](https://bobheadxi.github.io/unique-sequences/), or lounging on the living room couch with his housemates discussing how fantastically heartwrenching Netflix's [*End of the F\*\*king World*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6257970/) was, or out on a run listening to "[Non-Stop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9iLfPP4Ps8)" from that musical about Alexander Hamilton.

On Sundays, Robert tends to a small indoor garden that he has been setting up, growing plants in used jam jars left over from his excessive strawberry jam consumption.
