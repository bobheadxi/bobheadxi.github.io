<h1 style="font-weight:500;margin-top:-0.5rem;text-align:center;">about me!</h1>

Hey! My name is Robert and I am a mathematics student studying at the University of British Columbia with a passion for tech and building stuff.

My professional experience includes software engineering internships at [Sourcegraph](/sourcegraph) (where I currently work), [Riot Games](/riot-games), and the [Michael Smith Genome Sciences Center](/bcgsc), as well as part-time remote software development positions at startups like [Sumus Property Group](/sumus) and [RTrade Technologies](/rtrade-techologies/) while taking classes. See a summary of my experience [here](/#work-experience)!

Outside of work and class, I participated actively for several years as a [tech lead and co-president in UBC Launch Pad](/what-is-launch-pad), leading and mentoring teams of students on collaborative projects and driving programs and workshops aimed at building a community of aspiring software engineers at my university. I volunteered for some time as a [web developer for nwPlus](/nwhacks2019/) building the website and application system behind one of the largest hackathons in western Canada, nwHacks. I love experimenting with different technologies and ideas through [my projects](/open-source) and [writing](/blog).

<!--
My tech interests currently lie primarily in empowering people to build things better, faster, and more
effectively. Software has become an integral part of every facet of life, and I believe that ever-improving
tools, automation, and a culture of transparency (I have the open-source world to thank for pretty
much everything I know) will become a key driver of innovations to come.
I've tried exploring these areas myself with projects like [a self-hosted build and deployment platform](/inertia),
[automated benchmark visualisation](/gobenchdata-project/),
[tooling to set up branch deployments on a budget](https://bobheadxi.dev/appengine-branch-previews/),
[a foray into building a service to analyse project growth](https://bobheadxi.dev/timelines-recap/),
[some libraries](https://bobheadxi.dev/tags/#library), and more - and I hope to continue learning
more and one day making more significant contributions!

When not fiddling with tech, I have a soft spot for [the great outdoor, making gifs that loop](https://pics.bobheadxi.dev/), eating, and writing.

## why "bobheadxi"?

The online handle `bobheadxi` is one I've had for too long to abandon, so I use it for most things
nowadays. The `xi` part stands for `11`, and nothing else :)
