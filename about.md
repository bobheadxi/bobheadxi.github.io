Hi! I am a mathematics student studying at the University of British Columbia
with a passion for technology and [building cool things](https://bobheadxi.dev/open-source/).

My [professional experience](https://bobheadxi.dev/) includes time spent at
**Riot Games**, **RTrade Technologies**, and the **Michael Smith Genome Sciences Center**.
I've also worked as a [tech lead with UBC Launch Pad](https://bobheadxi.dev/tags/#launch-pad)
(a student-run software engineering club at my school) and as a
[web developer with nwPlus](https://bobheadxi.dev/nwhacks2019/) (the group
that organizes one of the largest hackathons in western Canada). A condensed
(though often outdated) summary of my work is available in my 
[resume](https://resume.bobheadxi.dev).

I have a soft spot for [mountains, trees, making gifs that loop](https://pics.bobheadxi.dev/),
and [occasionally writing](https://bobheadxi.dev/blog/).
